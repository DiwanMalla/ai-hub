# AI Model Hub

AI Model Hub is a lightweight Next.js (App Router) site to collect, preview and interactively test AI models. The hub supports both browser-based inference (using Transformers.js with WebAssembly/WebGPU) and server-side inference (using Hugging Face Inference API) depending on the model type.

This repository includes example integrations:
- **BRIA RMBG 1.4** - Browser-based background removal using Transformers.js
- **BRIA FIBO** - Server-side text-to-image generation with structured JSON prompts

---

## Features

- **Centralized model configuration** (`src/config/models.ts`) to add new models quickly.
- **Flexible playground components**:
  - `ModelTryPanel.tsx` - For browser-based models (image segmentation, classification, etc.)
  - `FiboPanel.tsx` - For text-to-image models with Generate, Refine, and Inspire modes
- **Dynamic model pages** under `/models/[slug]` with model metadata, docs links and live playground.
- **Responsive, sticky navigation** that works on all screen sizes with accessible mobile menu.
- **Remote image proxy** (`/api/image-proxy`) to fetch remote images server-side and avoid CORS issues.
- **Server-side inference endpoints** for gated models and models requiring GPU acceleration.

---

## Getting started (development)

Requirements
- Node.js 18+ recommended
- pnpm / npm (examples use `npm`)

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes about running models in the browser
- Transformers.js runs model artifacts in the browser using WASM or WebGPU. Some models may require additional files or be gated (private) on Hugging Face; such models will fail to load in the browser unless you have proper access or use server-side execution.
- For the best in-browser performance enable WebGPU in a supported browser (Chromium-based browsers with WebGPU enabled). Transformers.js will fall back to WASM when hardware acceleration is not available.

---

## Add a new model

1. Open `src/config/models.ts` and add a new `ModelConfig` entry. Provide `pipeline.task`, `pipeline.model` and UI metadata.
2. Commit the changes. The homepage will list the new model and the `Try now` button will link to `/models/{slug}`.
3. If your model requires extra preprocessor or files that are private on Hugging Face, either make the files public or run the model server-side and add a server endpoint to proxy inference results.

## Project layout

- `src/config/models.ts` - central model definitions
- `src/components/ModelTryPanel.tsx` - reusable interactive playground (client)
- `src/app/page.tsx` - homepage that lists models
- `src/app/models/[slug]/page.tsx` - dynamic model page
- `src/app/api/image-proxy/route.ts` - serverless route to fetch remote images and return data-URIs

## Deployment

You can deploy this Next.js site to Vercel, Netlify, or any platform that supports Next.js App Router. For Vercel, push to GitHub and import the repo; Vercel will pick up the Next.js settings.

If you expect large model assets to be fetched from Hugging Face, consider either hosting assets in a CDN or running server-side inference and exposing a slim API.

## Troubleshooting

- "Unauthorized access" while loading model files: some models/files on Hugging Face are gated and require credentials. If you hit this, either use a public model or run server-side with an authenticated Hugging Face token.
- CORS errors when loading remote images: use the `/api/image-proxy` endpoint (already wired to the playground) to avoid browser CORS restrictions.
- Slow model loads: the first-time load downloads model artifacts — subsequent in-memory loads are faster. Use smaller models for demos.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Add new models to `src/config/models.ts` and open a PR. Please include model license/source links in `links.huggingface` and `links.documentation` when available.

- **🔒 Privacy-First**: All image processing happens locally—your data never leaves your device
- **⚡ Fast**: Hardware-accelerated inference with WebGPU support
- **📱 Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 🤖 Featured Model

**BRIA RMBG 1.4** - Production-grade background removal

- Enterprise-safe training data (12k+ licensed images)
- Supports diverse subjects: people, products, animals, text
- Optimized for e-commerce, creative workflows, and gaming
- [View on Hugging Face →](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Transformers.js** - Run ML models in the browser
- **WebGPU** - Hardware acceleration for AI inference

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18 or higher
- Modern browser with WebGPU support (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, or Safari Technology Preview)

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
