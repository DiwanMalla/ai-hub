## AI Model Collections

This site is a Hugging Face inspired hub for cataloguing AI models and instantly trying them. The first spotlight is [briaai/RMBG-1.4](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4), a production-grade background removal model.

### Features

- Hugging Face–style navigation, hero, and resource cards
- Rich model summary with training data distribution highlights
- Interactive playground that calls the Hugging Face Inference API (background removal demo)
- Server-side API route that proxies requests, so your token stays on the server

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18+ (Next.js requirement)
- A Hugging Face access token with permission to run `briaai/RMBG-1.4`

Create an `.env.local` file and store your token to avoid typing it each time:

```bash
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=hf_xxx
```

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and paste any HTTPS image URL to remove its background. You can also supply the token per request in the playground if you prefer not to use environment variables.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Notes on usage & licensing

- BRIA RMBG 1.4 is released under the `bria-rmbg-1.4` license. Commercial usage requires a license from BRIA AI.
- Respect any terms for assets you upload through the playground—only use images you are allowed to process.

### Extending the collection

The layout is ready for more models. Duplicate the data blocks in `src/app/page.tsx`, or add new sections/components to reflect your model catalog (text-to-image, LLMs, etc.).
